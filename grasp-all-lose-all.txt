Once a dog stole a piece of meat from a shop. Holding it in his mouth, he was running 
beside a stream. When the dog was crossing a bridge over the stream, it discover an image in the 
water bellow. But he thought it was another dog with another piece of meat.
The dog stopped on the bridge and looked down very carefully. He became greedy to get the other pieces
of the meat. In fact, he saw his own image in the clear water of the canal and took it for another dog.
So he howled at the image instantky the piece of meat fell in to the water. The dog jumped following the piece of meat 
that was dropping. Alas! he failed to get it. He somehow swam to the other bank of the canal and remained unfed.
