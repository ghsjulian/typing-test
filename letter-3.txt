Subject : Letter fo antisocial activities in our locality
Sir,
Through the columns of your esteemd daily. I venture to voice my
views about the problem of anti-social activities in our locality.
For the last several years some anti social elements are in oparetion in the area 
They rob the pressers by thier valuables at the point of dagger. Sometimes
they wander with revolvers and bobs and raid shops. Houses and banks sometimes 
they turn violent and destroy public and private properties for filmsy issues.
In a word unrest and violence are spreading in very walk in of life and th
and the people of the area are panic.

I therefore, request you to write an editional note to create a strong public
opinon against such anti-social activities in our locality.

Yours faithfully
Ghs Julian                                               ................
