axe with that he used to cut the wood but he lost that emidietly. He was not money so that he could buy a new one. He was thinking what to do.
He was very depressed and blaming his a lot. Suddenly he heared a voice and saw a fairy infront of him. 
The fairy asked him why he was crying. He told her everything. The fairy took pity to him. She went into
the river and come back with a golden axe, The fairy asked to the woodcutter that it was his axe? then the 
woodcutter answered to the fairy that that was not his axe. Then the fairy again feel into the river and come back with a
silver one and she again asked to the woodcutter is it your? The woodcuter again replied that it is not his
